## How do I find the value of AM_MAKEFLAGS?

When invoking make, you can use the command-line parameter -p or --print-data-base to have it print the values of all rules and variables it encounters. Redirecting the output to a file and searching for AM_MAKEFLAGS in that file will show you whether the variable is defined and if so, what its value is. See section 9.7 Summary of Options for some extra information.


First, note that it is rarely necessary nor desirable to look at either the Makefile.in generated by automake, or the Makefile built by configure (via config.status) from the Makefile.in template. These are not intended form human consumption. Reading them is similar to looking at the machine code generated by the compiler rather than the original source code.

AM_MAKEFLAGS is a mechanism through which the package maintainer can essentially append text to MAKEFLAGS. Every invocation of make will be called with AM_MAKEFLAGS as an argument. It is (very) often left undefined, and can be ignored. If the maintainer did choose to define it, the definition would be in Makefile.am, and the line providing the definition would simply be copied verbatim into Makefile.in by automake.




autoconf generate configure file from configure.ac

automake generate Makefile.in from Makefile.am

.configure generate the makefile.
