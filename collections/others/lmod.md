## Why does Lmod install differently?Â¶

Lmod automatically creates a version directory for itself. So, for example, if the installation prefix is set to /apps, and the current version is X.Y.Z, installation will create /apps/lmod and /apps/lmod/X.Y.Z. This way of configuring is different from most packages. There are two reasons for this:

Lmod is designed to have just one version of it running at one time. Users will not be switching version during the course of their interaction in a shell.
By making the symbolic link the startup scripts in /etc/profile.d do not have to change. They just refer to /apps/lmod/lmod/... and not /apps/lmod/X.Y.Z/...
