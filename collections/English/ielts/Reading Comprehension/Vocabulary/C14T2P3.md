### Q27-33



**27. Section A    What people are increasingly expected to do**



**答案解析：**
A段里提到“all as a means to becoming more productive（所有这些做法都是用以变得更加高产的手段）”以及“essentially teaching people how to organise well.（本质上都是在教人们如何很好地安排组织各项事务）”都在呼应A段第一句话：Organisation is big business.（规划归序是件大事）。而段落提到的“ more strategies for time management, project management and self-organisation（更多的策略来进行时间管理、项目管理和自我组织管理）”，“countless seminars and workshops（数不清的研讨会和讲习班）”还有“The number of business schools and graduates has massively increased （与此有关的商业学校和毕业生数量激增）”都在表达大家用尽各种各样的手段去达到organisation。相当于在用具体的举例和说明在回答选项F“What people are increasingly expected to do（人们越来越被期望做什么）”



**28.Section.   B Complaints about the impact of a certain approach**

B段里的“the number of businesses that fail has also steadily increased.（失败企业的数量也一直在稳定上升）”“Work-related stress has increased（与工作相关的压力一路看涨）”是两个具体的负面影响，对应了A选项里的“Complaints about the impacts”，而“a certain approach ”指的就是第一段提到的“organisation”。



**29. Section C.   Early recommendations concerning business activities**



**答案解析：**
C段第三句的“Writing in the first half of the 20th century（= early）, he（指代Frederick Taylor） designed a number of principles to improve（= recommendations） the efficiency of the work process（= business activities ）”，意为“他在20世纪的上半叶里就开始著书立说，设计岀了一系列原则来提升工作流程的效率”，对应选项C“Early recommendations concerning business activities”。



**30. Section D  Fundamental beliefs that are in fact incorrect **



**答案解析：**
D段第一句“New research suggests that this obsession with efficiency is misguided.（= incorrect）”说“这种对效率的痴迷是有误导性的”。再结合第二句话的“it’s the basic assumptions（= Fundamental beliefs ） we hold in approaching how we work.”说到“真正的问题在于我们在着手进行工作时所持有的一个基本假设。”，也就对应了选项B的“Fundamental beliefs that are in fact incorrect ”。后面的内容更详细具体介绍了basic assumption以及误导的点是什么。



**31 Section E   Evidence that a certain approach can have more disadvantages than advantages**

**答案解析：**
E段第一句“recent studies show that order actually has diminishing return（有序性的效用实际上是边际递减的）”强调这个段落整体还是一种消极的描述。第二句详细解释边际递减“会逐步减弱到某个临界点，过了这个点以后再去增加秩序性就只会降低生产力”也就是过了一定界限，就会弊大于利。对应了选项I里的“more disadvantages than advantages”，而“a certain approach”指的是“order”。



**32. Section F  How to achieve outcomes that are currently impossible**



**答案解析：**
F段第一句话里的“enable everyone involved to engage as one organic group（每个人都充分参与进来，形成一个有机的群体）”是选项G里“how”问方法的具体回答。第二句话里提到的“These environments can lead to new solutions（= achieve outcomes） that, under conventionally structured environments ... would never be reached.（= currently impossible）（这样的环境可以催生出一些全新的解决办法，而在传统的一切井然有序的环境下...永不可能出现这些思路）”继续补充完选项G里的细节信息。



**33. Section G  Organisations that put a new approach into practice**



**答案解析：**
G段“In recent times companies（= Organisations） have slowly started to embrace this disorganisation（= a new approach ）.”第二句话里的“Many of them embrace it（= put into practice ）”表明了“很多公司都接受了它”。后面还举了三个大公司作为具体“接纳这样的“无组织无纪律性””的例子。对应了选项D“Organisations that put a new approach into practice”。



**34. Section H.    Neither approach guarantees continuous improvement**

**答案解析：**
H段里说到“... disorder, much like order, also seems to have diminishing utility, and can also have detrimental effects on performance if overused.”意味着“无序跟有序非常类似，其有用性貌似也是会边际递减的，如果过度使用也会对各方面表现产生有害影响。”。整理一下也就是无序和有序达到某点之后都会开始出现副作用，而不会一直产生效益，所以对应选项H的“Neither approach guarantees continuous improvement”。

### Q35-37

35. **Numerous training sessions are aimed at people who feel they are not *productive* enough.**

**题目定位：**Numerous training sessions

**空格预判：**名词，根据空格前的feel要填和人相关的描述

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文A段**
We are told that we ought to organise our company, our home life, our week, our day and even our sleep, all as a means to becoming more productive.（Q35 答案词）Every week, countless seminars and workshops数不清的研讨会和工作坊（= Numerous training sessions 诸多培训课程） take place around the world to tell a paying public that they ought to structure their lives in order to achieve this.（指代前面提到的becoming more productive）
这道题的替换有点难理解，可以换一个角度去思考。原文提到“所有这些做法都是用以变得更加高产的手段。”也就是变得高产后就不需要这些手段了，所以“还没有达到高产才需要这些手段”这层理解就符合了题干的意思。



36. **Being organised appeals to people who regard themselves as *perfectionist***

**题目定位：**Being organised，regard themselves as

**空格预判：**名词，根据空格前的regard themselves as填和人相关的描述

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文B段**
This rhetoric（指代上句话的“tell a paying public that they ought to structure their lives in order to achieve this” = Being organised） has also crept into the thinking of business leaders and entrepreneurs, much to the delight of self-proclaimed 自称的（= regard themselves as 视自己为） perfectionists（Q36 答案词） with the need to get everything right.

原文中答案词后缀是“-ist”结尾，是表示“从事...的人”，符合空格的预判。



37. **Many people feel *dissatisfied* with aspects of their work.**

**题目定位：**aspects of their work

**空格预判：**名词，根据空格前的feel填一种感觉

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文B段**
A large proportion of workers from all demographics（= many people） claim to be 声称感到（=feel）dissatisfied（Q37答案词）with the way their work is structured and the way they are managed.（= aspects of their work 他们工作的方方面面）.
在所有人口统计数据中都有很大一部分员工称自己对工作的组织安排方式和被领导管理的方式感到不满。
通过题干和原文的对应，dissatisfied“不满意”符合对空格的预判，表示一种感觉。

### Q38 - 40

38. **Both businesses and people aim at order without really considering its value.**

**题目定位：**both businesses and people，aim at order

**题目考点：**without considering its value
找到定位信息后需确认是否企业和人们都以秩序为目标【而没有真正考虑其价值】

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文D段**
The result is that businesses and people（= both businesses and people ） spend time and money organising themselves for the sake of organising（= aim at order）,无论公司还是个人都在花费时间和金钱为了有序而努力去有序，
 rather than actually looking at the end goal and usefulness of such an effort.而不是去关注进行这种努力尝试的最终目标和有用性。

原文里“rather than actually looking at the end goal and usefulness of such an effort”和题干里的考点“without considering its value”是替换，所以答案选TRUE。



| Keywords in questions         | inferred from the passage                                    |

39. **Innovation is most successful if the people involved have distinct roles.**

**题目定位：**Innovation is most successful，people involved

**题目考点：**have distinct roles
找到定位信息后需确认是否所涉及的人【有不同的角色】时，创新是最成功的。

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文F段**
In fact, research shows that, when innovating（= innovation）, the best（= most successful） approach is to create an environment devoid of structure and hierarchy在进行创新时，最好的方法就是创造出一个没有任何组织结构和上下级别的环境, and enable everyone involved（= people involved） to engage as one organic group.让置身其中的每个人都充分参与进来，形成一个有机的群体。

题干的考点“have distinct roles”和原文里的“as one organic group.”含义矛盾，前者强调区别性、个体性，后者强调一致性、整体性。所以答案选FALSE。



| Keywords in questions | inferred from the passage |
| :-------------------- | ------------------------- |

40. **Google was inspired to adopt flexibility by the success of General Electric.**



**题目定位：**Google，the success of General Electric，adopt flexibility

**题目考点：**was inspired by
找到定位信息后需确认是否通用电气的成功【启发了】谷歌去采用灵活性。

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文G段**
In similar fashion, the former chairman of General Electric（定位词） embraced disorganisation（= adopt flexibility）通用电气（General Electric）的前任主席也以类似的方式接纳了混乱无序性, putting forward the idea of the ‘boundaryless’ organisation. Again, it involves breaking down the barriers between different parts of a company and encouraging virtual collaboration and flexible working.
Google（定位词） and a number of other tech companies have embraced (at least in part) these kinds of flexible structures（= adopt flexibility）谷歌和一系列其他的技术公司也都（至少是部分上）釆用了这类灵活的组织结构+, facilitated by technology and strong company values which glue people together.

定位词和替换虽然都可以在原文中找到，但是关于考点的描述并未出现，即原文中并未提到was inspired by的这层关系。
