第二句提及：20年后，Janssen将他在东南亚看到的这个基本想法发展成了一种便携式设备。
其中initial inspiration = basic idea, new product = portable device，from...to=developed...into，因此选择C选项【从最初的灵感到新产品】。



**15 Section B**

**Cleaning water from a range of sources**

**答案解析：**
B段第一句提及：这个设备可以净化各种水源；第二句进一步描述了它的价值，比如也可以净化被污染的水源。

### Q21-26



**How the Desolenator works** 

The energy required to operate the Desolenator comes from sunlight. The device can be used in different locations, as it has **wheels**. Water is fed into a pipe, and a **film** of water flows over a solar panel. The water then enters a boiler, where it turns into steam. Any particles in the water are caught in a **filter**. The purified water comes out through one tube, and all types of **waste** come out through another. A screen displays the **performance** of the device, and transmits the information to the company so that they know when the Desolenator requires **servicing**.



21.

**题目定位：**sunlight, different locations

**空格预判：**名词，该设备有...

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现在C段**

Its main selling point is that unlike standard desalination techniques, it doesn't require a generated power supply: just sunlight（定位）.It measures 120cm by 90 cm, and is easy to transport, thanks to（as） its two wheels（答案词）. 

其中，因果关系表达替换thanks to = as，can be used in different locations（可在不同地点使用）被逻辑替换成easy to transport（容易运输），从属关系表达替换it has = its。



22. 

**题目定位：**Water，pipe，solar panel

**空格预判：**名词单数

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现在C段**

Water（定位） enters through a pipe（定位）, and flows as a thin film薄膜（答案词） between a sheet of double glazing and the surface of a solar panel（定位）, where it is heated by the sun.

定位词water，pipe和solar panel确认后，找到并列结构and，结合不定冠词a，找到从属关系of前面的film，确认为答案词。



23. 

**题目定位：**particles

**空格预判：**名词单数

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现在C段**

The device has a very simple filter（答案词） to trap捕捉particles（定位）, and this can easily be shaken to remove them. 

trap = are caught in，主被动语态替换。定位词particles从题干的前置变成了答案句里的后置，结合不定冠词a，确定答案词为filter。



24.



**题目定位：**purified water，tube

**空格预判：**名词，从另一个tube里出来的是.....

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现在C段**

There are two tubes（定位） for liquid coming out: one（指代tube）for the waste（答案词） 一 salt from seawater, fluoride, etc. 一 and another（指代另一个tube）for the distilled water (=purified water).
distilled water 蒸馏水= purified water纯净水。



25.



**题目定位：**screen

**空格预判：**名词，和device有从属关系

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现在C段**

The performance（答案词）of the unit （= the device）is shown on an LCD screen（定位）and transmitted to the company which provides servicing when necessary.

该设备的性能显示在液晶屏上，并在必要时传送给公司，由公司提供维修服务。

和The unit = the device有从属关系的名词是performance，所以答案是performance。



26.

**题目定位：**company

**空格预判：**名词，需要.....

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现在C段**

The performance of the unit is shown on an LCD screen and transmitted to the company（定位） which provides servicing（答案词）when necessary.

通过并列结构and，预判出25题和26题离得不会很远。Desolenator requires servicing = the company provides servicing when necessary，进行了逻辑上的主客体切换。
