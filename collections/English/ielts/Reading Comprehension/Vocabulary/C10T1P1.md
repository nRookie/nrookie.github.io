### Q1- 5

**1**  Examples of ancient stepwells can be found all over the world.

**题目定位：**Examples of ancient stepwells

**题目考点：**can be found all over the world

找到定位信息后需确认古代阶梯井的例子是否【在世界各地】都可以找到

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文第一段**

During the sixth and seventh centuries, the inhabitants of the modern-day states of Gujarat and Rajasthan in north-western India developed a method of gaining access to clean, fresh groundwater during the dry season for drinking, bathing, watering animals and irrigation.

印度西北部的古吉拉特邦和拉贾斯坦邦的居民发明了一种方法，在旱季获取清洁的、新鲜的地下水，用于饮用、洗澡、喂养动物和灌溉。

However, the significance of this invention - the stepwell - goes beyond its utilitarian application.

这项发明的意义——阶梯井——超越了它的实用用途。

归纳一下第一段里的信息：阶梯井是由印度西北部的古吉拉特邦和拉贾斯坦邦的居民发明的。发现地是特定位置的，和题干考点说的“all over the world”相矛盾，所以选FALSE。



**2. Stepwells had a range of functions, in addition to those related to water collection.**

**题目定位：**water collection

**题目考点：**had a range of functions

找到定位信息后需确认Stepwells是否【具有】除集水以外的其他功能

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文第二段**

与水收集相关的功能在文章首段已经明确提到：“...a method of gaining access to clean, fresh groundwater during the dry season for drinking, bathing, watering animals and irrigation.” 

......发明了一种方法，在旱季获取清洁的、新鲜的地下水，用于饮用、洗澡、喂养动物和灌溉。

第二段出现题目考点对应信息：

During their heyday, they（指代stepwells） were places of gathering, of leisure and relaxation and of worship for villagers of all but the lowest classes.

它们是村民聚会、休闲、放松和礼拜的场所，除了最低阶级的人。

原文中“聚会、休闲、放松和礼拜的场所”是考点“a range of functions”的具体替换，答案选TRUE。





**3. The few existing stepwells in Delhi are more attractive than those found elsewhere.**

**题目定位：**few existing，Delhi，elsewhere

**题目考点：**more attractive than

找到定位信息后需确认德里现有的少数阶梯井比其他地方的阶梯井是否【更具吸引力】

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文第二段**

Most stepwells are found dotted round the desert areas of Gujarat (where they are called vav) and Rajasthan (where they are called baori),（= elsewhere） while a few also survive（= few existing） in Delhi.

（定位词）大多数阶梯井分布在古吉拉特邦(在那里它们被称为vav)和拉贾斯坦邦(在那里它们被称为baori)的沙漠地区，而德里也有一些。

原文中只能通过定位词找到答案句，但是其他地方的阶梯井和德里的阶梯井之间并没有就吸引力进行对比关系上的描述，所以答案选NOT GIVEN。

**4. It took workers many years to build the stone steps characteristic of stepwells.**

**题目定位：**build the stone steps

**题目考点：**took workers many years

找到定位信息后需确认工人们是否【花了很多年时间】才建造了阶梯井特有的石阶

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文第三段**

As their name suggests, stepwells comprise a series of stone steps（= build the stone steps） descending from ground level to the water source (normally an underground aquifer) as it recedes following the rains.

顾名思义，阶梯井由一系列从地面到水源(通常是地下蓄水层)的石阶组成。

通过stone steps可以找到答案句，但往下一句读就是第五题的答案句。根据判断顺序出题原则，stone steps所在的答案句里没有题干考点“是否花了工人很多年”的描述，所以选NOT GIVEN。





5. The number of steps above the water level in a stepwell altered during the course of a year.



**题目定位：**The number of steps，water level

**题目考点：**altered, during the course of a year 

找到定位信息后需确认阶梯井中高于水位的阶梯在一年内是否【发生了变化】

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文第三段**

When the water level（定位词） was high, the user needed only to descend a few steps to reach it; when it was low, several levels（= The number of steps） would have to be negotiated.

当水位很高时，使用者只需要走下几步就可以到达;当阶梯较低时，就必须越过几个阶梯。

总结一下原文的内容就是：水位高和水位低时使用者要走的阶梯数不一样，符合题干的考点“altered”。答案选TRUE。
