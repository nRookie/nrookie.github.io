### Q19

**About a thousand of the women interviewed by the researchers had learnt to read when they were children.**

**题目定位：**a thousand of the women interviewed，when they were children

找到定位信息后需确认：研究人员调查的1000位女性，在童年时期，是否就已经学过阅读

**答案解析：**
根据a thousand定位在E段，但没有提及这1000名受访者是否在童年时学会了阅读。所以选择NOT GIVEN。

### Q20

**Before the National Literacy Crusade, illiterate women had approximately the same levels of infant mortality as those who had learnt to read in primary school.**

**题目定位：**National Literacy Crusade，illiterate women, infant mortality，primary school

**题目考点：**approximately the same levels（考对比）

找到定位信息后需确认：在全国扫盲运动之前，文盲母亲与在小学时学习过阅读的母亲，其婴儿死亡率是否大致相同。

significantly lower 与 approximately the same levels 矛盾。

### Q21

**Before and after the National Literacy Crusade, the child mortality rate for the illiterate women stayed at about 110 deaths for each thousand live births.**

**题目定位：**National Literacy Crusade, the child mortality rate, illiterate women

**题目考点：**stayed at about 110 deaths（也可作为定位词） for each thousand live births 
找到定位信息后需确认：全国扫盲运动前后，文盲母亲的婴儿死亡率，是否在110/1000。

①In the late 1970s, the infant mortality rate for the children of illiterate mothers was around 110 deaths per thousand live births.（文盲母亲的婴儿死亡率：110/1000）

②In 1985, after the National Literacy Crusade had ended, the infant mortality figures for those who remained illiterate ... remained more or less unchanged.（全国扫盲运动结束后，仍旧不识字的母亲的婴儿死亡率几乎没有什么改变），和题目中的语义一致，所以选择YES。

### Q22

**The women who had learnt to read through the National Literacy Crusade showed the greatest change in infant mortality levels.**

**题目定位：**National Literacy Crusade, women who had learnt to read, infant mortality levels

**题目考点：**the greatest change 

In 1985, after the National Literacy Crusade had ended

① the infant mortality figures for those who remained illiterate and for those educated in primary school remained more or less unchanged. （仍旧不识字的、和小学期间接受过教育的母亲，其婴儿死亡率几乎没有什么改变）

②For those women who learnt to read through the campaign（定位）, the infant mortality rate was 84 per thousand, an impressive 21 points lower than for those women who were still illiterate.（那些在这场运动中学会阅读的母亲，其婴儿死亡率为84/1000，比仍然不识字的母亲的婴儿死亡率整整降低了21%）；

这三类不同文化水平的母亲，其婴儿死亡率的前后对比可知，在这场运动中学会阅读的母亲，其婴儿死亡率变化最大。所以选择YES。



### Q23

**The women who had learnt to read through the National Literacy Crusade had the lowest rates of child mortality.**

①For women educated in primary school, the infant mortality rate was ... at 80 per thousand.（在小学期间接受教育的母亲，其婴儿死亡率大幅降低，为80/1000）；



②For those women who learnt to read through the campaign, the infant mortality rate was 84 per thousand, （在这场运动中学会阅读的母亲，其婴儿死亡率为84/1000）；



#### Q24

**After the National Literacy Crusade, the children of the women who remained illiterate were found to be severely malnourished.**



**题目定位：**National Literacy Crusade, women who remained illiterate, malnourished

**题目考点：**after, found to be severely malnourished
找到定位信息后需确认：是否有调研证实，在全国扫盲运动后，依旧是文盲的母亲的婴儿严重营养不良。



**定位信息出现于原文F段**
根据malnourished（营养不良）可定位到F段最后一句：The children of the newly-literate mothers were also better nourished than those of women who could not read.（新识字的母亲的孩子也比不识字的母亲的孩子得到了更好的营养。）。



原文已知两种不同母亲的孩子的营养水平不同，而关于孩子本身营养水平的高低，原文并无提及。所以选择NOT GIVEN。



#### Q25-26

**Which TWO important implications drawn from the Nicaraguan study are mentioned by the writer of the passage?**

**题目定位：**two important implications，Nicaraguan study

**题目考点：**根据题干two important implications drawn from the study可知需找尼加拉瓜研究的两个重要推论。



**①定位信息出现于原文F段：**
For those women who learnt to read through the campaign, the infant mortality rate was 84 per thousand, an impressive 21 points lower （=the effects can be seen very quickly）than for those women who were still illiterate.（在这场运动中学会阅读的母亲，其婴儿死亡率为84/1000，比文盲母亲的婴儿死亡率低了整整21%）。

效果在全国扫盲计划结束后就有所展现，且效果十分显著，对应选项C.The effects of maternal literacy programmes can be seen very quickly.（全国扫盲计划的效果可以很快看到）

**②定位信息出现于原文H段：**
The Nicaraguan study may have important implications（二次定位）；
There is increasing evidence that female education, at any age, is 'an important health intervention in its own right'.（女性教育，在任何年龄阶段，都是对健康非常重要的影响因素）；
The results of the study lend support to the World Bank's recommendation that education budgets（=money spent on female education） in developing countries should be increased, not just to help their economies, but also to improve child health. （这项调研的结果支持了世界银行对于发展中

国家增加教育预算的建议，这不仅能够帮助发展中国家发展经济，同时也能提高孩子的健康水平）；
对应选项E. Money spent on female education will improve child health（花在女性教育上的钱将改善儿童健康）。

③选项ABD均无提及：
选项A：教育成熟女性比教育年轻女孩更好
选项B：其他国家的类似运动也会同样成功
选项D：改善儿童健康可以迅速影响一个国家的经济
