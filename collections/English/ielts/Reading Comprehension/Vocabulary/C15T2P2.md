### Q18-22

**The woolly mammoth revival project** 

Professor George Church and his team are trying to identify the **genetic traits** which enabled mammoths to live in the tundra. The findings could help preserve the mammoth's close relative, the endangered Asian elephant. 



According to Church, introducing Asian elephants to the tundra would involve certain physical adaptations to minimise ***heat loss***. To survive in the tundra, the species would need to have the mammoth-like features of thicker hair, **ears** of a reduced size and more **insulating fat**.



Repopulating the tundra with mammoths or Asian elephant/mammoth hybrids would also have an impact on the environment, which could help to reduce temperatures and decrease **emissions**.

Necessary adaptations would include smaller ears, thicker hair, and extra insulating fat必要的适应性将包括更小的耳朵、更浓密的毛发和额外的隔热脂肪（= physical adaptations身体适应性，出现定位词）, all for the purpose of reducing（=to minimise） heat loss（Q19答案词） in the tundra, and all traits found in the now extinct woolly mammoth.'

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文E段**

This repopulation（=repopulating） of the tundra and boreal forests of Eurasia and North America with large mammals could also be a useful factor in reducing carbon emissions（Q22答案词） – elephants（出现定位词）punch holes through snow and knock down trees, which encourages grass growth. This grass growth would reduce temperatures（出现定位词）, and mitigate减少（=decrease出现定位词） emissions（Q22答案词） from melting permafrost.

原文中提到，这种大型哺乳动物的种群恢复可以成为减少碳排放的有用因素，并通过大象进行说明：大象在雪地上打洞，打倒树木，从而鼓励草的生长。这种草的生长会降低温度，并减少融化的永久冻土的排放。所以原文中与减少有关的单词共有两处，均可以作为答案词：carbon emissions/emissions。

### Q23-26

**23. Reintroducing an extinct species to its original habitat could improve the health of a particular species living there.**



**题目关键词：**reintroducing，an extinct species，original habitat，improve，health

**题目解读：**再引进一个灭绝物种到原有栖息地，可以改善在那里生活的一个特有物种的健康情况

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文B段**

There is no carnivore now in Tasmania（= original habitat） that fills the niche which thylacines once occupied（现在塔斯马尼亚没有任何肉食动物能填补袋狼曾经占据的位置）,' explains Michael Archer（=正确选项B） of the University of New South Wales. He points out that in the decades since the thylacine went extinct（=an extinct species）, there has been a spread in a 'dangerously debilitating' facial tumour syndrome which threatens the existence of the Tasmanian devils（面部肿瘤综合症一直在蔓延，威胁着袋獾的存在）, the island's other notorious resident.

Thylacines would have prevented this spread because they would have killed significant numbers of Tasmanian devils. ‘If that contagious cancer had popped up previously, it would have burned out in whatever region it started. The return of thylacines to Tasmania could help to ensure that devils are never again subjected to risks of this kind.' 

袋狼能够阻止这种疾病的传播，因为它们可以杀死大量的袋獾。“如果这种传染性癌症以前出现过，那么它将会在其开始蔓延的地方消失殆尽。袋狼的回归可有助于确保塔斯马尼亚州的袋獾不再遭受这种风险。”

根据原文，袋狼能够阻止这种疾病的传播，以及袋狼的回归可有助于确保塔斯马尼亚州的袋獾不再遭受这种风险。说明再引进袋狼可以改善袋獾的健康情况。

Beth Shapiro更愿意把辩论的焦点放在如何利用这种新兴技术来充分了解各种物种最初灭绝的原因，说明她认为聚焦于动物灭绝的原因很重要。



**25. A species brought back from extinction could have an important beneficial impact on the vegetation of its habitat.**

**题目关键词：**extinction，important beneficial impact，vegetation，habitat

**题目解读：**一个从灭绝中重生的物种会对栖息地的植被有重要的有益影响

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文D段**

According to Novak（=正确选项A）, a hybridised band-tailed pigeon, with the added nesting habits of a passenger pigeon（= A species brought back from extinction）, could, in theory, re-establish that forest（=vegetation出现定位词） disturbance, thereby creating a habitat（出现定位词） necessary for a great many other native species to thrive.

根据诺瓦克的说法，一只杂交的带尾鸽，加上客鸽的筑巢习性，理论上可以重新建立森林干扰，从而为许多其他本地物种的繁衍创造必要的栖息地。

原文中的re-establish...disturbance，creating a habitat necessary for a great many other native species to thrive与题目中an important beneficial impact相对应。

‘I would also say there's an incredible moral hazard to not do anything at all,’ she（= Beth Shapiro，对应正确选项C） continues, ‘We know that what we are doing today（=current efforts） is not enough（= insufficient）, and we have to be willing to take some calculated and measured risks.’

我还想说，如果什么都不做，会有不可思议的道德风险，她继续说，我们知道，我们今天所做的还不够，我们必须愿意承担一些经过计算和衡量的风险。

原文中提到“我们现有对保护生物多样性做出的努力是不足的”的人只有Beth Shapiro。
