31.

**题目定位：**place，in the sea

**空格预判：**名词

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文C段**

The majority of geo-engineering projects so far carried out - which include planting forests in deserts and depositing（= place）iron（答案词）in the ocean（= in the sea） to stimulate the growth of algae - have focused on achieving a general cooling of the Earth.

通过place和in the sea的分别替换，对应到depositing放置和in the ocean可以得出中间的iron就是答案词。

32.

**题目定位：**encourage，form

**空格预判：**名词，根据空格前的form预判填物质类单词

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文C段**

The majority of geo-engineering projects so far carried out - which include planting forests in deserts and depositing iron in the ocean to stimulate（= encourage） the growth（= form） of algae（答案词） - have focused on achieving a general cooling of the Earth.

原文中“促进藻类生长”符合题干“encourage...to form”的替换，所以答案词为algae藻类。

33.

**题目定位：**aerosol sprays，stratosphere，create，reduce the amount of light

**空格预判：**名词，根据空格前的create预判填物质类单词

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文D段**

The concept of releasing aerosol sprays（定位词）into the stratosphere（定位词） above the Arctic has been proposed by several scientists.

This would involve using sulphur or hydrogen sulphide aerosols so that sulphur dioxide would form（= create）clouds（答案词）, which would in turn, lead to a global dimming.（= reduce the amount of light）

原文中“这将转而导致全球变暗”符合题干“减少光亮”的替换，而在这个过程中形成的clouds为答案。

34.

**题目定位：**strong，Greenland ice sheets

**空格预判：**名词，被strong修饰

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文D段**

Scientists have also scrutinised whether it’s possible to preserve the ice sheets of Greenland（定位词）with reinforced high-tension高压（= strong）cables（答案词）, preventing icebergs from moving into the sea.

在原文中通过定位词Greenland ice sheets找到答案句后，发现strong的替换high-tension，被修饰的cables就是答案词。

35.

**题目定位：**plant trees in Russian Arctic，reflect radiation

**空格预判：**名词，根据空格后的to预判填目的是reflect radiation的单词

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文D段**

Meanwhile in the Russian Arctic（定位词）, geo-engineering plans include the planting of millions of birch trees.（= plant trees）

Whereas the region's（指代Russian Arctic） native evergreen pines shade the snow and absorb radiation, birches would shed their leaves in winter, thus enabling radiation to be reflected（= reflect radiation） by the snow（答案词）.

原文中“从而使辐射被雪反射”中的by引出是雪做的辐射反射，符合题干的预判“目的是reflect radiation的单词”，所以答案词snow。

36.

**题目定位：**change the direction，cold water into ice-forming areas

**空格预判：**名词，根据空格前的of预判填可以有方向的单词

**答案解析：**
**定位信息出现于原文D段**

Re-routing（= change the direction） Russian rivers（答案词） to increase cold water flow to ice-forming areas（= cold water into ice-forming areas） could also be used to slow down warming, say some climate scientists.

原文中提到”改变俄罗斯河流的路线“符合题干的”改变方向“的替换，但因为答案词只能填一个，所以答案为rivers。
