**答案解析：**
**题目出现于原文H段**
The New Zealand Government（= national） has developed a New Zealand Disability Strategy（=policy initiative）and has embarked on a wide-ranging consultation process.
题干里的关键词在原文中由抽象变具体了：新西兰政府是具体的国家，制定了《新西兰残疾人战略》是具体的政策。

2. **a description of a global team effort**

**题目关键词：**a global team effort

**题目解读：**关于全球团队付出的努力的描述

**答案解析：**
**题目出现于原文C段**
The International Institute of Noise Control Engineering (I-INCE), on the advice of the World Health Organization, has established an international working party（= a global team）, which includes New Zealand, to evaluate noise and reverberation control for school rooms（= effort）.
题干里的effort被替换成了具体的内容“评估学校房间的噪声和混响控制”。a global team被替换成an international working party。

3. **a hypothesis as to one reason behind the growth in classroom noise**

**题目关键词：**a hypothesis，one reason，the growth in classroom noise

**题目解读：**关于教室噪音增长背后原因的假设

**答案解析：**
**题目出现于原文B段**
Education researchers Nelson and Soli have also suggested that recent trends in learning often involve collaborative interaction of multiple minds and tools as much as individual possession of information（= a hypothesis as to one reason的具体描述）.
This all amounts to heightened activity and noise levels（替换= the growth in classroom noise）, which have the potential to be particularly serious for children experiencing auditory function deficit.
教育研究人员 Nelson 和 Soli 还提出，最近的学习趋势通常涉及多种思维和工具的协作互动，以及个人拥有信息。这一切都意味着活动和噪音水平的提高，这对于患有听觉功能缺陷的儿童来说可能尤其严重。

4. **a demand for suitable worldwide regulations**

**题目关键词：**demand，suitable worldwide regulations

**题目解读：**对制定适当的国际制度的需求

**答案解析：**
**题目出现于原文I段**

It is imperative that the needs（= demand） of these children are taken into account in the setting of appropriate international standards（= suitable worldwide regulations） to be promulgated in future.
（关于学校房间噪音的文献）似乎只对那些经历涉及听觉功能缺陷的其他残疾的学生给予了有限的关注。在制定将来颁布的适当国际标准时，必须考虑这些儿童的需要。

While the detrimental effects of noise in classroom situations are not limited to children experiencing disability, those with a disability that affects their processing of speech and verbal communication could be extremely vulnerable（= more at risk from noise than others）. The auditory function deficits in question include hearing impairment, autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit disorders (ADD/ADHD).（= medical conditions）
原文中举例了：听力障碍，自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）和注意力缺陷障碍（ADD / ADHD）作为题干medical conditions抽象变具体的替换。
