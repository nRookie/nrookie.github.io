27.



**题目定位：** 1870, Polar Research meeting, 1st International Polar Year 

**空格预判：**根据表格纵向结构得知，填两个数字，表示年份

**答案解析：** 
**DOCTOR：**In 1870(定位词). And it was called the Polar Research Meeting(定位词).
And then, not long after that, they organised something called the First International Polar Year（定位词）.
**INTERVIEWER：**And that took place when exactly?
**DOCTOR：**Over two years from 1882 to 1883(Q27答案词).

注意：1882读作eighteen eighty-two，其中eighteen中的n和后面的eighty因为发音的问题连读在了一起，听起来就像是eightee -neighty-two（1892）。
1882和1892的关键在于元音的不同：1882的元音为/ei/ ，n[ˈeɪti]；而1892的元音为/ai/ ， [ˈnaɪnti]
