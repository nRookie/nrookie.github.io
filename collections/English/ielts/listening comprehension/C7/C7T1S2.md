**C** 25 years. （25年）

**答案解析：**
The company started twenty-five years ago(干扰项，“公司创建于25年前”，并不是题干重点“organising holidays的时间，所以排除A项). It actually opened as a retail chain selling camping equipment, and then twenty years ago, it bought a small number of campsites in the UK, and began offering camping holidays(20年前开始提供假期服务，所以Q11答案为B项).
The company grew rapidly and has been providing holidays in continental Europe for the last fifteen years.(干扰项，最近15年将假期业务开展到欧洲，并不是开始organising holiday的时间，因此排除A项)

**A** France. （法国）
**B I**taly.   （意大利）

**答案解析：**
If you book a camping holiday with us, you'll have a choice of over three hundred sites.
In Italy we now have some 64 sites(干扰项，64相较于300来说，不是最多的，因此不符合题干中的限定词most，因此排除B项) that we either own, or have exclusive use of.
France is where we have the majority of sites(=most，法国是营地最多的地方，因此Q12答案为A项), and we currently have a project to expand into Switzerland(干扰项，未提及营地数量是否是最多的，因此排除C项).

**答案解析：**
We believe our holidays offer superb facilities for the whole family.
Parents who want their children(定位词) to be fully occupied for all or part of the day can take advantage of our children's activities(定位词).
These are organised by our well-qualified and enthusiastic staff.
Each day(=every day 定位词) kicks off with a sports match, perhaps football, or volleyball(干扰项，”每天以一个体育比赛开始，可能是足球，或者排球”，所以足球并不是每天都能有，因此排除A项）, followed by an hour of drama for everyone(“接着每个人都有一小时的戏剧表演”，因此Q13答案为B项).This may include singing or dancing, mime or other activities.
ln the afternoon,there's a different art activity for each day of the week including a poster competition or model making(干扰项，”每天下午都有一个不同的艺术活动，包括海报比赛，或者模型制作”，所以模型制作并不是每天都能有，因此排除C项）.

**选项重点：**
**A** 9.30 p.m.

**答案解析：**
What's more, our sites are truly child-friendly, and, with this in mind, we operate a no-noise rule(定位词) in the evenings.
Children's evening activities usually finish at 9.30, or occasionally 10(干扰项，“孩子们的晚间活动通常结束在9.30，有时候10.00”，这并不是no noise rule的时间，因此排除AB项), and from 10.30 holiday-makers are expected to be quiet(=no noise) in the areas where there are tents(Q13答案为C项).

**C** must be taken out at the time of booking. （必须在预订时办理）

**答案解析：**
We want nothing to go wrong on a PS Camping holiday, but if it does, we also want all customers to be insured.
If you haven't organised an annual insurance policy of your own you'll need to take out the low-cost cover we offer(干扰项，“如果你还没有购买一个个人年险，你需要购买我们提供的低成本保险”，但这并不是A项中“按年收费”的意思，因此排除A项) and we require that you arrange this when you make your holiday reservation(=be taken out at the time of booking，“当你预定假期业务的时候就要办理好”，因此Q15答案为C项).

In return, we'll send you a thank-you present(=a free gift, 作为回报，我们会送给你一份答谢礼，因此Q16答案为A项), which you can choose from a list of high-quality items.

**题目定位：** toys

**答案解析：**
Inside, a box of games and toys(定位词) can be found(Q18答案为A项，因为toys可以在帐篷里找到), and children's tents can be hired if required(干扰项，“儿童帐篷”如果索要是可以得到的，但这并不是题干的toys，因此不选C项).



19.

**题目定位：**cool boxes 

**答案解析：**
All tents have a fridge(干扰项，文中的意思是“所有帐篷里都有冰箱”，但是题干问的是cool boxes, 二者并不是同样的东西，所以不选A项), and if you want to spend the day on the beach, for example, ask for(=on request) a specially designed PS Camping cool box(定位词，cool box 要通过索要才能得到，因此Q19答案为C项), which will keep your food and drinks chilled.
