31. Anita first felt the Matthews article was of value when she realised

**题目定位：**first, Matthews article, value

**B** the relevance of connections he made with music. （与音乐之间的关联）
**C** the impressive size of his research project. （他的研究项目规模惊人）

**答案解析：**
I'm left-handed myself and I actually didn't see any relevance to my own life(干扰项，"我自己是左撇子，实际上我觉得这和我自己的生活没有任何关系"，并没有提及到左撇子给“我”带来了困难，更没提及到帮助，因此排除A项) when I happened to start reading an article by a sports psychologist called Peter Matthews(定位词).
He spent the first part of the article talking about handedness in music instead of sport, which I have to say almost put me off from reading further(干扰项，“他在文章的第一部分讨论了音乐中的用手习惯，而不是体育，这几乎让我无法进一步阅读”，因此确实有提及到music，但是此时的“我”，并没有发现这篇文章的价值，违背了题干的关键词value，因此排除B项).
But(信号提示词) what I soon became struck by was the sheer volume(=impressive size “数量之大”等于“令人印象深刻的规模”，因此Q31答案为C项) of both observation and investigation he had done in many different sports and I felt persuaded that what he had to say would be of real interest(=value “有意思，有兴趣”等于“有价值” 进一步佐证C项正确).

**B** aiding sportspeople as they plan tactics for each game. （帮助运动员为每场比赛制定战术）
**C** developing suitable training programmes for sportspeople. （为运动员制定合适的训练计划）

**答案解析：**
I think Matthews' findings will be beneficial(=value 定位关键), not so much in helping sportspeople to work on their weaker side(干扰项，“帮助运动员应对弱势的作用没那么大”，听到not，排除A项), but(信号提示词) more that they can help them identify the most suitable strategies(=tactics 策略，因此Q32正确答案为B项；虽然有提及到C项的suitable，但是并没有提及到“训练计划”，因此排除C项) to use in a given game.

**A** know nothing about the influence of handedness. （对惯用手的影响一无所知）

**C** underestimate what science has to offer sport. （低估了科学力量）

**答案解析：**
Although most(定位词) trainers(=coaches 定位词) know how important handedness is(干扰项“大多数教练都知道惯用手的重要性”，并非一无所知，因此排除A项), at present they are rather reluctant to make use of(=underestimate “不情愿使用”等于“低估”) the insights scientists(=science) like Matthews can give(“不愿意利用马修斯等科学家所能提供的见解”等于“低估了科学的力量，因此Q33答案为C项), which I think is rather short-sighted because focusing on individual flexibility is only part of the story(干扰项，“关注个人灵活性只是其中的一部分”，并不等于“关注了错误的方面”，即：不是关注的方面错误，而是关注的不全面，因此排除B项)

Researchers examined a number of variables, e.g.type of instrument played, regularity of practice undertaken and length of time playing instrument.
...and found the following(信号提示词，提示发现结果，重点出现): keyboard players had high levels of mixed-handedness(“键盘乐手有很高的混合用手习惯”，但是没有任何一个选项是关于“键盘乐手”的，因此听完直接过掉即可), whereas string players like cellists and violinists strongly favoured one hand(干扰项，“大提琴手和小提琴手这样的弦乐演奏者非常喜欢单手”，但是题干重点为“greater mixed"，因此排除B项).

Studies showed that(信号提示词，提示研究结果，重点出现) apes consistently using the same hand fished out 30% more ants than those varying between the two(“一直使用同一只手的猿类要比两只手换着用的猿类多捕获30%的蚂蚁”，能多吃到食物，对于猿类来说，就是一种成功，符合A项的描述，因此Q35答案为A项).
