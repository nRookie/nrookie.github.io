## Question

21.

**题目定位：**Individuals,different, ideas, learning experiences

**空格预判：**根据上下文结构得知，填一个名词

**答案解析：**
**PHILIP：**
Well, I've been looking at why individualism, I mean individual differences(定位词), are such an important area of management studies.
When you think about any organization, be it a family business or a multinational company, they are all fundamentally a group of people working together.
But it's what these individuals contribute to their places of work that makes you realize how important they are.
Of course they bring different ideas(定位词), but(信号提示词) it's also(并列结构) their attitudes(Q21答案词) and their experiences of learning(定位词).
Diversity is important in these areas too.



22.

**题目定位：**Work behaviour differences, due to, personality 

**空格预判：**根据上下文结构得知，填一个名词

**答案解析：**
**TUTOR：**So why do people behave so differently from one another at work(=work behavior differences 定位词)?
**PHILIP：**There are lots of reasons(=due to 定位词) but(信号提示词) research has shown a lot of it comes down to personality(定位词). And the other(提示另一点的到来) factor(=due to 定位词) is gender(Q22答案词).
It's a well known fact that men and women do lots of things in different ways, and the workplace is no different.



23.

**题目定位：**Effects, diversity, companies, Advantage, develops

**空格预判：**根据空格前的develops得知，填一个名词

**答案解析：**
**TUTOR：**Did you look at the effects(定位词) of this variation(=diversity 定位词) on companies(定位词)?
**PHILIP：**Yes, I did. On the positive side(=advantage 定位词), exposure to such diversity helps encourage(=develop 定位词) creativity(Q23答案词) which is generally an asset to a company.



**24** Janice thinks that employers should encourage workers who are

**题目定位：**Janice, employers, encourage, workers

**选项重点：**
**A** potential leaders. （潜在的领导者）
**B** open to new ideas.  （接受新思想）
**C** good at teamwork. （擅于团队协作）

**答案解析：**
**TUTOR：**
Thanks, Philip. So now I guess the two main things to remember here are to identify individual talent and then to utilize it.
So Janice, you were looking at identifying different talents in workers(定位词).
Do you think this is easy for managers(=employers 定位词) to do?
**JANICE：**
Well, currently teamwork(干扰项，提到了teamwork 并不代表就要选它，因为并不符合题干要求“雇主应该鼓励什么样的员工”这一含义，也不符合选项C中“擅长团队协作”这个意思，因此排除C项) is in fashion in the workplace and in my opinion the importance of the individual is generally neglected.
What managers(定位词第二次出现) should be targeting is those employees(=workers 定位词第二次出现) who can take the lead(=potential leader 因此Q24答案为A项) in a situation and are not afraid to accept the idea of responsibility(干扰项，提到了idea 并不代表就要选它，因为并不符选项B的限定词“new"，”新的观点“不等于”责任的观点“，因此排除B项) .



**25** Janice suggests that managers may find it difficult to



**题目定位：**Janice, managers, difficult

**选项重点：**
**A** form successful groups. （组建成功的团队）
**B** balance conflicting needs. （平衡各方的需求）
**C** deal with uncooperative workers. （处理应对不合作的员工）

**答案解析：**
**TUTOR：**
That's true Janice but unfortunately many managers(定位词) think the entire notion of encouraging individuality amongst their staff is far too hard(=difficult定位词).
**JANICE：**
Yes, that may be true but(信号提示词) I think one of the most important(信号提示词) tasks of managers(定位词) is to consider the needs of the individual on one hand and group co-operation and conformity on the other(=balance conflicting needs 原文的意思是：“一方面要考虑个人的需求，另一方面要考虑群体的合作和一致性”，即为“各方的需求”， 因此Q25答案为B项).
It requires creative thinking on the part of management to avoid tension.



**26** Janice believes employers should look for job applicants who

**题目定位：**Janice, employers, applicants 

**选项重点：**
**A** can think independently. （能够独立思考）
**B** will obey the system.  （遵守制度）
**C** can solve problems.  （能够解决问题）

**答案解析：**
**TUTOR：**
So Janice, what kind of people(=applicants 定位词) do you think companies should be looking for?
**JANICE：**
Well, it has to start from the very beginning when companies are looking for new employees.
When the personnel department is choosing between applicants(定位词) they need to look for someone who's broken the mould and can think for themselves(=think independently 因此Q26答案为A项).
Instead, people making these decisions often use a range of psychological tests to see if a person is a problem solver or will do as they're told. I'm not convinced these qualities are actually the most important. (干扰项，文中的意思是“做出这些决定的人通常会通过一系列心理测试来判断一个人是否是问题解决者或者会照他们说的做”, 看上去是提及到了BC项，但结合后文的 I'm not convinced these qualities are actually the most important.可知这并不符合题干的要求“Janice认为雇主应该找具备什么素质的职员”，因此排除BC项)



**27** Janice believes managers should



**题目定位：**Janice, managers

**选项重点：**
**A** demonstrate good behaviour. （表现出良好的行为）
**B** encourage co-operation early on. （鼓励尽早合作，配合）
**C** increase financial incentives. （增加和钱相关的激励）

**答案解析**
**TUTOR：**So how should managers(定位词) deal with this?
**JANICE：**Rewards. When an individual demonstrates the behaviour the organisation expects, some kind of incentive can be given(干扰项，文中的意思是“当individual个人表现出组织期望的行为时，可以给予某种激励”，这并不符合题干中的主语“manager"，因此排除A项)
What's important here is that(信号提示词) this happens right at the beginning(=early on，”应该在一开始就促成这种配合，即“个人表现出好的行为，组织就给相应的奖励”，这就是一种cooperation, 因此Q27答案为B项) so new recruits learn the rules of the system immediately.
Also the incentive should be something the individual actually wants, and this isn't always just money(干扰项，文中的意思是“应当奖励个人真正需要的东西，而不应该总是钱”，与C项不符，因此排除C项).





**28** All managers need to understand their employees and recognise their company's 

   Culture 

**空格预判：**根据空格前的 recognise their company's 得知，填一个名词

**答案解析：**
**TUTOR：**To come back to you, Philip. You were saying that recognition of good performers is essential. What else(信号提示词，提示下一点的到来) should managers(定位词) be looking for?
**PHILIP：**Well, managing people means you not only have an understanding of your employees(定位词), but you also(=and 并列结构, 定位重点) recognise(定位词) the culture(Q28答案词) of the organization(=company 定位词).
In fact, for some organizations creativity and individuality may be the last thing they want to see during working hours!
**TUTOR：**Very true.



**29** When managing change, increasing the company's may be more important than employee satisfaction.

**题目定位：**managing change, increasing, company's, more important, employee satisfaction

**空格预判：**根据空格前的increasing the company's 得知，填一个名词

**答案解析：**
**PHILIP：**Yes, but managing(定位词) people isn't as easy as it looks.
For example, change(定位词) in the workplace can be quite tricky, especially(信号提示词) if there's a need to increase(定位词) profit(Q29答案词).
And at times like these managers may have to give priority(=more important 定位词) to profit(Q29答案词) rather than individual staff needs(=employee satisfaction 定位词).
**TUTOR：**Yes, and that creates difficult situations for people.



**30** During periods of change, managers may have to cope with increased amounts of __ stress__.



**题目定位：**During periods of change, managers, cope, increased amounts

**空格预判：**根据空格前的of得知，填一个名词

**答案解析：**
**PHILIP：**
Yes but what's important is that(信号提示词) managers(定位词) are able to deal with(=cope with 处理，应对) quite high levels of(=increased 定位关键) personal stress(Q30答案词).
During times of change they should be thinking not only about the strain on their staff but take time out to think of themselves.
