**题目定位：**Car hire, don't, drive, expensive

**空格预判：**根据上下文语境得知，填一种交通方式

**答案解析：** 
**MAN：**Yes, I'm afraid so. But you have a number of options to get you there and you can always rent a car(=car hire 定位词) right here at the airport, of course.
**WOMAN：**Right. Well, I don't really want to drive(定位词) myself, so I'd like more information about public transport.
**MAN：**OK. In that case the quickest and most comfortable is a cab(Q1答案词) and of course there are always plenty available.
But it'll cost you(=expensive 定位词).

**题目定位：**Greyhound bus, $15, single, $27 .50 return

**空格预判：**根据空格前的directly to得知，填一个地点名词，表示“到什么地方去，通向哪里”

**答案解析：** 
**MAN：**You can also take a Greyhound bus(定位词) or there's an Airport Shuttle Service to Milton.
**WOMAN：**Hmmm, I think for that kind of distance a cab would be way beyond my budget.
But the bus sounds OK. Can you tell me how much that would cost?
**MAN：**Sure. Let's see, that would be $15 one way, or $27.50 return(定位词)... that's on the Greyhound.
**WOMAN：**Oh, that's quite cheap - great! But whereabouts does it stop in Milton?
**MAN：**It goes directly from the airport(干扰项，注意是“从机场出发”，并不是“到机场去”不符合题干中的“to"，因此排除) here to the City Centre(Q2答案词) and it's pretty fast.



3.

**题目定位：**long

**空格预判：**根据空格前的long得知，填一个名词

**答案解析：**
**WOMAN：**Oh, of course. Hang on, we're due to get there at 11.30 am.
**MAN：**Hmmm, too bad, the bus leaves at 3.45, so you would have quite a wait(=long wait，表示”要等很久“，因此Q3答案词为wait) - more than 4 hours.



4.

**题目定位：** Airport Shuttle, service

**空格预判：**根据空格后的service得知，填一个名词 或 形容词，用来修饰service

**答案解析：**
**WOMAN：**Oh, I see. Well, what about the Shuttle(定位词) you mentioned?
**MAN：**OK. That's the Airport Shuttle(定位词第二次出现) that will take you from the airport right to your hotel or private address.
It's a door-to-door(Q4答案词) service(定位词) and it would suit you much better, because there's one every two hours.



5.

**题目定位：**$35 single, $65 return

**空格预判：**根据空格前的need to得知，填一个动词

**答案解析：** 
**WOMAN：**So how much does that cost?
**MAN：**Let's see. Yeah, that's $35 one way, $65 return(定位词), so I guess it's a bit more expensive than the Greyhound.
**WOMAN：**Oh, that doesn't sound too bad, especially if it'll take me straight to the hotel.
**MAN：**But(信号提示词) you do need to(定位词) reserve a seat(Q5答案词).
