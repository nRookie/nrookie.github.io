C-outdated过时了

**答案解析：**

**Randhir：**That's OK. I believe you want us to do some work for you?

**Dave：**Yes that's right. Um, I'm responsible for student admissions to the college and I use a computer system（定位词出现） to help process student enrolments and to do the timetabling. But it really doesn't suit the way we work these days. It's over ten years old 它已经十年了，所以跟时间有关，过时了，选项C为正确答案 and although it was fine when it was first introduced刚引进的时候还是不错的，所以选项B为干扰, it is just not good enough now.
