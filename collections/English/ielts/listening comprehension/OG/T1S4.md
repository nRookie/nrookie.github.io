And examples of ceramics（定位词出现）are everyday things like earthenware pots, crockery, glassware and even concrete.

So how did it all begin（=date back）? Well it all started around（=approximately） 29,000（答案词） years ago when humans discovered that if you dig up some soft clay from the ground, mould it into a shape and then heat it up to a very high temperature, when it cools, the clay has been transformed into something hard and rigid.

**题目定位：**first figurines, made in, area

**空格预判：**名词, 填表示地点的词

**答案解析：**

And so 一 what did those first（定位词出现） humans do with their discovery? Well 一 they created figurines（定位词出现）which were small statues and which depicted animals or gods or any shape that the clay could be moulded into.

And all this activity was centred around（引出地点）southern Europe（答案词出现） where there is also evidence of ceramics that were created much later.



3.

**题目定位：**early humans, not use, pots，store

**空格预判：**名词

**答案解析：**

The early humans（定位词出现）also found a practical use for their discovery, such as storing（定位词）things like grain - although there were drawbacks.

The pots（定位词）were porous so that, although they could carry water（答案词）in them, it wasn't（否定词后置）possible to store it（指代water）over a long period.



4.

**题目定位：**Chinese, improved, quality, mixing, clay

**空格预判：**名词, 填一种材质

**答案解析：**

In China（定位词出现）at around 200 BC, they discovered that by adding（=mix） minerals（答案词出现）to the clay（定位词）they could improve both the appearance and the strength of the ceramics.

But it took nearly a thousand years before they perfected the process to produce high-quality ceramics known as porcelain.

5.

**题目定位：**Chinese porcelain, called

**空格预判：**名词, 专有名称

**答案解析：**

In fact, it became so valuable that it was known as（=called） white gold（答案词出现） and spies were sent to China（定位词）to discover what they did to the clay to produce such high-quality merchandise.

**空格预判：**名词, 注意并列关系

**答案解析：**

A German alchemist called Johann Friedrich Bottger（定位词出现）was asked by the king to make gold out of lead.

Unfortunately, Bottger failed to achieve this and soon gave up, but in order to please the king he attempted to make high-quality porcelain.

And after many years of experimentation, he discovered that by adding quartz（定位词）and（定位词）a material called china stone（答案词）to very high-quality clay he managed to get the same results that the Chinese had been achieving for the last 1,000 years.



7.

**题目定位：**glass production, similar, clay ceramics, apart from, rate

**空格预判：**名词

**答案解析：**

The main difference不同，与similar相反=apart from，between ceramics made from clay and glass（定位词出现）is that clay is made up of crystalline plates which become locked together in the cooling（答案词）process whereas glass cools too quickly for crystals to form.

由粘土和玻璃制成的陶瓷之间的主要区别在于，粘土由结晶板组成，这些结晶板在冷却过程中被锁定在一起，而玻璃冷却过快而无法形成晶体。

Apart from that, the process of heating up naturally occurring materials to transform them is the same.

除此之外，加热自然产生的材料以转化它们的过程是相同的。



8.

**题目定位：**Romans, introduced, use, glass, make

**空格预判：**名词

**答案解析：**

The origins of glass date back to 3500 BC but it wasn't until the Roman（定位词出现） Empire, 2,000 years ago, that the art of glass-blowing and the practical uses of glass became more widespread.

玻璃的起源可以追溯到公元前 3500 年，但直到 2000 年前的罗马帝国，玻璃吹制艺术和玻璃的实际用途才变得更加普遍。

One of the more innovative uses（定位词出现）was to use it in windows（答案词）as, up until then, they had just been holes in walls.

更具创新性的用途之一是将其用于窗户，因为在此之前，它们只是墙上的洞。



9.

**题目定位：**discovery, concrete, observing reactions, water, and

**空格预判：**名词, 注意并列关系

**答案解析：**

The Romans were also responsible for inventing concrete混凝土的发明（=discovery of concrete定位）.

And although the origins are uncertain, experts think that this is largely due to（定位词）the high level of volcanic activity in the area.

The Romans observed（=observing）that, when volcanic ash（答案词出现）mixes with（=and）water（定位词后置）and then cools, it gets extremely hard and almost impossible to break up.



10.

**题目定位：**build large, success, Roman Empire

**空格预判：**名词

**答案解析：**

As the Roman Empire（定位词出现）grew, the Romans needed to take control of the seas and for this they needed to build（定位词） harbours（答案词） capable of holding a fleet of ships（能够容纳一支舰队，说明面积大=large）.

随着罗马帝国的发展，罗马人需要控制海洋，为此他们需要建造能够容纳一支舰队的港口。

Pouring concrete mixture into the sea immediately started the hardening process and rather than just dissolving in the mass of water, the substance was tough and long-lasting.

This strange characteristic of concrete made a significant contribution to the success of the Roman Empire（定位词出现）.
