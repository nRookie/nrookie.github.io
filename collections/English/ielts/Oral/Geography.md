###  Do you like geography?

Well, I would say no. I really find geography to be quite boring.

in my opinion, geography is very similar to literature subjects like history, which requires a lot of memorization, and I hate to do that kind of stuff. I prefer science and mathematics because I love the process of calculation.



### Have you ever studied geography at school?
Yes, of course, because in china geography is a pre-requisite subject in the first year of high school, I always fell asleep during geography classes. and to pass the exam, I just mug up on it, and I did, Thank God,  in the next year, there is no geography because I have Chosen science,  which makes my life a lot easier.


### Are you good at reading a map?
Not really, the only thing I know about maps is the direction,the upside is north, the downside is south, the left is west, and the right is east,  but I'm good at using the navigator. for example, google maps, which helps me go anywhere I want.


### Would you visit a country because of its geographical location?

not really.

my main reason for choosing a place to visit and unwind is the historical or cultural background of a certain territory, based on the movie or anime I have watched.

To give an example, I visited japan because I love watching anime and wanted to find out if life in Japan is the same as the life described in anime.
which turns out to be false.  but I really enjoyed the trip.
