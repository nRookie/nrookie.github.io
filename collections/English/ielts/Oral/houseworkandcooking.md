## Do you do some cooking/help your family cook at home now?

No, I usually order food through the food delivery service when I'm busy. because except for the cooking itself, tidying up the mess is also needs quite a long hour.



## Did you do some house cleaning when you were young？

Yes, I did,  I lived in a dormitory since middle school.
therefore I had to take care of myself, I was doing things like, making my bed, doing the laundry, and mopping the floor.


## Do you have breakfast at home everyday?
No, I do not, I usually have breakfast at fast food restaurants like McDonald's near the subway. because getting to my company from my apartment requires a 1-hour commute and I cannot get up early.



## Do you want to learn how to cook well?

Yes, I do, because I think eating in is safer than eating out,
but I always order a take-out online because I'm busy at work.


## Do you think your home is clean and tidy?
I definitely agree, thanks to my mom who always makes sure that our house is neat and orderly all the time. She wants the house to be spotless and unstained, therefore, she cleans our humble abode almost every day. Although she gets a little exhausted, she still gains a sense of fulfillment from it.

## What housework do you like or dislike doing?
To be honest, I hate cleaning my room, however, I have to do it every now and then. I don’t really mind organizing my things but I prefer if someone else does the actual cleaning. I just find it time-consuming to sweep and mop the floor.
