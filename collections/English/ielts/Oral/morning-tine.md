### 1. Do you like getting up early in the morning?

I don't like getting up early because I have trouble sleeping most of the night. I have evenings when I have lots of tasks to finish which makes me sleep late. Although sometimes when it's necessary, I have to wakeup early for some commitments.




### 2. What do you usually do in the morning ?

sometimes I think I have something like bipolar disorder,
which makes me stays up until morning, then I will solve some algorithm problem on the leetcode platform,
which is a platform used by the programmer.


### 3. What did you do in the morning when you were little? Why?

Well, I think just like most kids, first, I would wake up and fold my linen. And then, I would go to the bathroom to brush my teeth and wash up my face. Finally, I would have breakfast with my parents and then either of them would send me to school.

### 4. Are there any differences between what you do in the morning now and what you did in the past?
Absolutely, since my wake up time is different. I used to wake up at the same hour, but now, considering my job and different schedules, I wake up at different times. Being a child, things were easy and fundamental, but as an adult, things get messy in the mornings. Not to mention, on weekends, I don’t even wake up early.

messy 肮脏的

fundamental 基本的

 
###  5. Do you spend your mornings doing the same things on both weekends and weekdays?Why
