backpropagation is an algorithm for computing that crazy complicated gradient.





Stochastic gradient 



backpropagation is the algorithm  for determining how a single training example would like to nudge the weights and biases,



but in terms of what relative proportions to those changes cause the most rapid decrease to the cost.
