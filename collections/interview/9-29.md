4. data structure 

Hash map 

key conflict

linked list, how to improve it.





5. Data Base question

do you know what is index ?





what is the internal implementation of index.



what is a primary key exactly ?



**By default, a primary key is automatically created by taking the object name, adding an ID to the object name, and assigning a primary column value of 1**.



if we do not create a primary key, will the database create a primary key for us??

Yes



How about a composite index ? what is the sturucture of composite index ?

聚集索引，联合索引，组合索引，索引的区别

https://blog.csdn.net/Abysscarry/article/details/80792876



**多个单列索引**在**多条件查询**时优化器会选择**最优索引策略**，**可能只用一个索引，也可能将多个索引全用上！** 但多个单列索引底层会建立多个B+索引树，比较占用空间，也会浪费一定搜索效率，故如果只有**多条件联合查询时最好建联合索引！**

最左前缀原则：

顾名思义是最左优先，以最左边的为起点任何连续的索引都能匹配上，
注：如果第一个字段是范围查询需要单独建一个索引
注：在创建联合索引时，要根据业务需求，where子句中使用最频繁的一列放在最左边。这样的话扩展性较好，比如 userid 经常需要作为查询条件，而 mobile 不常常用，则需要把 userid 放在联合索引的第一位置，即最左边

 



How do we scale a relational database ？ We want to save a lot of data in mysql.



How about if we have multiple tables, we need to join these tables,

if we shard this tables to two different machine, how do we solve this problem ?

```
Idempotent Methods

 A request method is considered "idempotent" if the intended effect on
 the server of multiple identical requests with that method is the
 same as the effect for a single such request.  Of the request methods
 defined by this specification, PUT, DELETE, and safe request methods
 are idempotent.
 
 Like the definition of safe, the idempotent property only applies to
 what has been requested by the user; a server is free to log each
 request separately, retain a revision control history, or implement
 other non-idempotent side effects for each idempotent request.
 
 Idempotent methods are distinguished because the request can be
 repeated automatically if a communication failure occurs before the
 client is able to read the server's response.  For example, if a
 client sends a PUT request and the underlying connection is closed
 before any response is received, then the client can establish a new
 connection and retry the idempotent request.  It knows that repeating
 the request will have the same intended effect, even if the original
 request succeeded, though the response might differ.
