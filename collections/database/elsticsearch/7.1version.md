### Query context and Filter Context



By default, Elasticsearch sorts matching search results by **relevance score**, which measures how well each document matches a query.

The relevance score is a positive floating point number, returned in the `_score` meta-field of the [search](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/search-request-body.html) API. The higher the `_score`, the more relevant the document. While each query type can calculate relevance scores differently, score calculation also depends on whether the query clause is run in a **query** or **filter** context.



#### Query Context

In the query context, a query clause answers the question “*How well does this document match this query clause?*” Besides deciding whether or not the document matches, the query clause also calculates a relevance score in the `_score` meta-field.

Query context is in effect whenever a query clause is passed to a `query` parameter, such as the `query` parameter in the [search](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/search-request-body.html) API.



### Filter context

In a filter context, a query clause answers the question “*Does this document match this query clause?*” The answer is a simple Yes or No — no scores are calculated. Filter context is mostly used for filtering structured data, e.g.





- *Does this `timestamp` fall into the range 2015 to 2016?*
- *Is the `status` field set to `"published"`*?



Frequently used filters will be cached automatically by Elasticsearch, to speed up performance.

Filter context is in effect whenever a query clause is passed to a `filter` parameter, such as the `filter` or `must_not` parameters in the [`bool`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/query-dsl-bool-query.html) query, the `filter` parameter in the [`constant_score`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/query-dsl-constant-score-query.html) query, or the [`filter`](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.1/search-aggregations-bucket-filter-aggregation.html) aggregation.

### Boolean query

A query that matches documents matching boolean combinations of other queries. The bool query maps to Lucene `BooleanQuery`. It is built using one or more boolean clauses, each clause with a typed occurrence. The occurrence types are:

##  Match query

Returns documents that match a provided text, number, date or boolean value. The provided text is analyzed before matching.

The `match` query is the standard query for performing a full-text search, including options for fuzzy matching.





> Fuzzy Matching (also called Approximate String Matching) is a technique that helps identify two elements of text, strings, or entries that are approximately similar but are not exactly the same.
